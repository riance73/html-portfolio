 <H3>The Stand</H3>
 <p>This is my favorite movie because it sticks to the book. It is very engaging.</p>
 <H3>PS I Love You</H3>
 <p>This is a heartbreaking movie. I love it because you really connect to the characters. It is one of the only movies that has ever made me cry.</p>
 <H3>Fifth Element</H3>
 <p>This is one my favorite movies because it pulls you in right from the start. There is action, paranormal, mystery, and drama.</p>
