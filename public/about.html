  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>
    I'm Jennifer Dorcy — a passionate and detail-oriented professional with over 20 years of experience in education, science, and curriculum design. After a rewarding career as a high school and middle school science teacher, I made a bold and exciting shift into the world of full-stack web development and emerging technologies.
  </p>

  <p>
    My teaching background sharpened my ability to break down complex concepts, build inclusive digital content, and collaborate across teams — all of which I now apply to my software development work. I’m currently completing full-stack developer training through both <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/full-stack-developer/" target="_blank">freeCodeCamp</a> and the <em>Complete Full-Stack Web Development Bootcamp</em> on Udemy.
  </p>

  <p>
    My projects include a functional task manager app, a birthday invitation site, and a responsive portfolio. I’m continually expanding my skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git, and UI design, and recently earned the <strong>IBM Web Development Foundations</strong> certification. I'm also exploring AI tools and plan to integrate them into future development projects.
  </p>

  <p>
    Outside of coding, I hold a BS in Biology, a Master of Education from UMass Boston, and an MS in Nutrition from Johnson & Wales University. I bring a unique blend of analytical thinking, creativity, and empathy to every project I take on — whether in tech, education, or wellness.
  </p>

  <p>
    I’m currently seeking remote or local (Greater Boston area) opportunities in software development, tech education, or instructional design. I'm available for work starting in October and open to apprenticeships or entry-level roles with growth potential.
  </p>

  <p>
    Let’s build something impactful together!
